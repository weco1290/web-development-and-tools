# INFO6250 Project1 - Server-side Dynamic Site

**Due Sun Feb 16, 11:59pm PT**

Special Notes:
- This is a big part of your grade, please check the requirements CAREFULLY
- This assignment involves a lot of detailed work, please give yourself plenty of time to complete it
- It is absolutely not worth the risk to copy or generate work.  Make sure you understand the expectations about copying, ChatGPT/Copilot/etc, and referencing anyone's work (see "do-not-copy-work.md" in this repo and ask any questions you have)

## Submission Instructions

- Start from the up-to-date main branch (git checkout main; git pull origin main)
- Create a feature branch named 'project1' (git checkout -b project1)
- Create a `package.json` and necessary files to complete the work described in this README
  - You can add/modify any files except as limited below
    - In particular: Do not load external JS, no client-side/browser JS, do not change `words.js`
      - You are permitted to change the words in `words.js`, but should add no logic
      - We may replace your `words.js` with our own and your code should still work
  - Remember that all work you submit must be based on my code or represent your writing
    - Do not start from someone else's code - write it all yourself
    - ChatGPT and other LLMs do not count as writing it yourself
- Add, commit, and push the branch to github
    - Don't forget to check the files, this project is not in work/, you may have .gitignore mismatch!
- Create a PR to merge to main
- Be sure to include the reviewer(s).

## Goals and Expectations

- You will build a web-based word guessing game
  - Each player will play independently of the other players
  - This app will use only backend-generated HTML
  - This app will use no front-end JS
- You will demonstrate the skills taught in class
- Extra Credit: You have visuals, styling, or functionality beyond the minimum required

### General Hints
- It may be valuable to have data structures representing certain concepts, such as a "game", that can be passed around rather than passing around the data to locate that data structure.  This is a suggestion, not a requirement.
  - Example: Rather than having a list of guesses in user data and passing every function the username to look that up, have an object representing a "game" that you can pass around instead.

## Functional Expectations

For this project:  
- **Possible words** means the words found in the list in `words.js` when the program runs
    - If the list in `words.js` changes before the program runs, your program will treat the new list as the "possible words"
- A **game** means one specific secret word for this user is chosen from the possible words and the user takes multiple turns making guesses
  - A **new game** means a new secret word for this user is selected, the number of guesses made is reset to 0, and the all words in the possible words list are again valid guesses 
    - Statistics about previous games may be preserved if you wish
        - This means you can track how many games have been played, how many have been finished, the lowest number of turns before a game was finished, the largest number of turns before a game was finished, or anything other such details that do not impact the current game being played by any player
- **valid guess** means a guess that is:
  - is one of the possible word, and
  - has not already been guessed this game 
- **invalid guess** means a guess that:
- is not one of possible words, OR
- is a possible word that has already been guessed this game
- **correct guess** means a valid guess that IS the secret word (case-insensitive)
- **incorrect guess** means a valid guess that is not the secret word
    - A guess that is in the list of possible words but is not the secret word is a "valid guess" and an "incorrect" guess the first time it is guessed in a game, but guessing that word a second time in a game is an "invalid guess" and neither a "correct guess" nor an "incorrect guess"
- Guesses are not case-sensitive, so "these" is both a "valid guess" and a "correct guess" if the secret word is "THESE", but a "valid guess" and an "incorrect guess" if "THESE" is a possible word but not the secret word of this game, and "these" (regardless of case) has not already been guessed this game.
  - A guess that shares all of the letters of the secret word but is NOT the secret word (such as EAT vs TEA), is NOT a correct guess and does not win the game

### Home Page

When the User loads the page (path: `/`)
- the site will determine if the user is logged in (based on `sid` session cookie)

- If the user is not logged in:
  - the page will display a login form instead of the below content
  - the login form will ask for a username but will NOT ask for a password
  - the login form will POST to `/login` (see "The Login Flow")

- A logged in user will see:
  - A list of words the secret word could be (possible words)
    - You should consider the different ways to show this list in HTML in a way that is easy to read and works for different browser window sizes without requiring horizontal scrolling
  - A list of any previously made valid guesses and how many letters each matched (see "Making a Guess")
  - A count of how many valid guesses they have made so far this game (essentially, a score a player wants to keep low)
  - What their most recent valid guess was, and how many letters it matched
    - or, if their previous guess was invalid they will be told that guess and that it was invalid
        - There is no requirement to show an invalid guess if it was not the most recent guess(!)
  - If their previous guess was correct: a message saying they have won
    - Users that have "won" should not be able to make additional guesses
    - They may choose to logout
    - They may choose to start a new game
    - Make sure a user that wins, logs out, and then logs in still sees their win state and can start a new game
  - If their previous guess was incorrect: an option to make another guess (see "Making a Guess")
  - An option to logout
  - An option to start a new game
  - Notice: All of the above is true even if they reload the page. The user stays logged in and the displayed information does not change
  - You can choose how to display the above information.  You might combine the list of available words and the list of guessed words and matches, or you might have them as separate lists, for example. What matters is:
    - The information is all present
    - The information is understandable to an average user
- A different user will see the above information for themselves, not the information of a different user, and their game is not altered if another player is playing a separate game at the same time
  - Use different browsers or browser-profiles to test this - each profile can log in separately as different users

### Making a Guess

A guess will be sent as a POST to the path `/guess`
- The server will check for a valid session id
  - If there is not a valid session id, the page will display a message and a login form
    - Hint: an invalid session id could come from manually changing your cookie or restarting the server (the server will forget all session ids, but the browser will still have the sid cookie)
- The server will check for a valid guess
  - If the guess is not valid, the server will update the server state for that player and respond with a redirect to the Home Page 
  - If the guess is valid, the server will update the server state for that player and respond with a redirect to the Home Page
  - Note: this is different than the error message from the express-login assignment.  Here the knowledge of what error to show needs to be in the information stored in the server.
  - Hint: See "Home Page" for ideas on what details the server state will have to know.  If we had a database much of that information would be there, but because we do not we will simply hold the state data in different objects.  Remember to keep information for different players separate.

The guess is evaluated for how many letters match between the guess and secret word (see "Starting a New Game"), regardless of position of the letters in the word and regardless of the upper/lower case of the letters.  
- Hint: This should sound like an earlier assignment

### Starting a New Game

A new game begins when a user starts a new game or logs in for the first time.
- A secret word is picked at random from the list of available words
  - Hint: see Math.random() at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random to get a random number, and Math.floor() to convert that to an integer.
  - The list of available words is exported by the provided `words.js` file
    - `require()` this file in your JS to get the array of words.
    - You may change the words in words.js, but you should not otherwise alter the file.
      - Notice: You should not otherwise alter the file.  Don't add more logic to words.js, though you can have a file that has more logic and that itself loads words.js.
      - Your game code must still work if we replace words.js with a different list of words that are exported the same way

If the user is starting a new game by virtue of logging in for the first time, it is done as part of login and does not require extra navigation in the browser

If the user is manually starting a new game, it is done as a POST to `/new-game`
- The server will check for a valid session id
  - If there is not a valid session id, the page will display a message and a login form
    - Hint: an invalid session id could come from manually changing your cookie or restarting the server (the server will forget all session ids, but the browser will still have the sid cookie)
- If there is a valid session, after updating the state, the response will redirect to the Home Page.

To help with grading, the server will `console.log()` the username and the chosen secret word whenever a new game is started for a player.
- This is not a debugging console.log().  Be careful to make sure all debugging console.log() statements are removed before turning in your project

Important: No information is sent to the browser that allows someone to learn the secret word without playing the game

### The Login Flow

Login is performed as a POST to `/login`
- It will send only the username, no password
- If the username is valid the server will respond with a `sid` cookie using a uuid.
  - a "valid username" is one composed only of allowed characters
    - You select the list of valid characters
  - Enforce the validity of the username by having an allowlist of valid characters
  - explicitly disallow username "dog" 
    - This simulates a user with a bad password, since we aren't using passwords
  - after setting the cookie header, respond with a redirect to the Home Page
  - a user with a valid username will always be treated as if the are an existing user
    - There is no user registration in this application - any valid, non-"dog" username is allowed to login
- If the username is invalid (but not "dog"), respond with a login form that contains a message about the username being invalid
- If the username is "dog", respond with a login form that contains a message saying "dog" is not granted access.
    - These "show a login form that contains a message" should NOT be the results of redirects
If a username that is in the middle of a game logs in
- They will be able to resume their existing game
- Hint: This means the game info is not tied to their session id, it is tied to their username
  - Hint2: Have one object that connects sessions to usernames, and a second, separate object that connects usernames to game state

### The Logout Flow

A user logs out with a POST to `/logout`
- Even a user with no session id or an invalid session id can logout
- This will clear the session id cookie (if any) on the browser
- This will remove the session information (if any) from the server
  - Hint `delete obj["key"]` will remove the "key" property from object "obj"
- Logout does NOT clear the game information from the server
  - The user can log in as the same username and resume the game
- After the logout process the server will respond with a redirect to the Home Page

Hint: Be sure to test login/logout, resuming a game already in-progress, and related requirements!

## Allowances
* You may reuse files or parts of files from previous assignments or classes that you wrote - but they will be graded by the criteria here!
- You may use JS Classes if you wish, but you will be graded on demonstrating the concepts from class, so make sure you can still do so
* You may create your HTML as you see fit, but it must be fundamentally semantically valid and follow other best practices from class
* You may create the CSS as you see fit but you must follow the best practices given in class and the Restrictions below
* You may add icons and background images but there is no requirement to do so
- The game does not need to work on mobile screens, but it should look appropriate at a range of desktop sizes
- This is not a web design class, so I do not expect art.  However, even fully backend coders must be able to present their work pleasantly, so you are expected to have at least a minimal amount of spacing and usable UX.

## Restrictions
* You must install `express`, `cookie-parser` modules ONLY
  - Do not install/use `express-session` module
  - Do not install/use `uuid` module  
    - Use the built in `crypto.randomUUID()`
  - `jest` or `vitest` are allowed if you add unit tests for your content, but (sadly) no test code will be graded
    - Remember that a unit test should not test the server itself.
- Do not write your code as ES Modules (import), you must use CommonJS (require)
  - We will switch to ESM later in the semester
* Do not use external JS other than base express and cookie-parser
* Do not use external CSS libraries
* Do not use floats to do more than manage flowing text with images
* Do not use HTML tables for layout or CSS table layouts
* Do not use client-side/browser-side Javascript
* Do not use Map() or Set() for this assignment
  * In order to ensure you know how to use objects and arrays for the purposes
  - .map() on arrays is different than the Map data structure created with Map().  You are allowed and encouraged to use .map() on arrays for assignments
* Do not use `alert`, `prompt`, `confirm`, or other blocking JS
* Do not use localStorage or other client-side storage other than a cookie to hold your session id
* Do not use iframes
* Do not use meta tag refreshes
* Do not use CSS preprocessors, minifiers, or other tools to modify your CSS

## Grading

Note: The assignment is to show your understanding of the material from class.  If you don't show your understanding of class material, you can lose points, even if your assignment "works".  

**Do NOT copy or generate your work (see "do-not-copy-work.md" at the root of this repo).**

This assignment is graded as a base of 100 points
- Each Critical Requirement you miss is a minimum of -10 points, and may lose more
- Each Additional Requirement you miss is -2 points.  There may be MANY non-critical requirements, and they add up!
- Each Bonus Requirement is +2 points, and the Project grade may exceed 100%
  - Remember that this project is 25% of the course grade, so just one +2 on this project is worth more than a -2 on every single assignment added together 
  - You should first fulfill all the Critical and Additional Requirements for the same reasons: missing them hurts more on a Project
- If you are not showing the lessons from class, your grade will be worse or even given a 0. Each week builds on the material from the previous week so it is important that you learn and practice the lessons from class.

### Critical Requirements
- Your submission demonstrates that you practiced the overall purpose of the assignment
- You create a PR with your code for this assignment roughly following the course process
- Your code runs (with or without correct answers) when invoked using `npm install` and `node server.js`
- PR does not contain changes to files unrelated to the assignment
  - a root `.gitignore` file IS related and may be included
- Your user data is not stored in a session and that data is sustained after logout/login
- You correctly handle user data for multiple users
- You do not request or store passwords or password-related data
- The same user logging in with multiple browsers will get different session ids for each
- Each request that requires the user be logged in has the sid checked
- The necessary backend routes (`/guess`, `/login`) properly sanitize the input and respond as required
- No information that would reveal the secret word that isn't the results of guesses is sent to the client
- Only the sid cookie is stored on the client side
- You obeyed each of the listed "Do not" under "Restrictions"
- Do not use `style` attributes
- Do not write `<style>` elements

### Additional Requirements
- Your PR has the correct branch name and follows other course expectations for a PR
- Your commit message should be a single sentence that completes the phrase "these changes _______" 
  - Without including the words "these changes"
- Your commit message makes sense if someone reading it doesn't know what assignment it is part of
- You removed/updated any comments that no longer apply to your files
- You followed the MVC practices shown in class
  - The exact files, file names, and details can vary as long as you are following an MVC breakdown
- Your home page dynamically shows the correct HTML without performing a redirect
- A successful login creates the session and ends with a redirect to the home page
- You handle invalid usernames as required
- Your check to determine invalid usernames is based on allowlisting, not denylisting
- You handle username "dog" as required
- Only users with a valid session id are shown the option to logout
- Users with a valid session id cookie are not prompted to login
- Explicitly logging out removes both the sid cookie and the sid in server memory
- You followed the best practices listed in the course so far, including but not limited to (each a separate requirement):
  - You used `const` instead of `let` when a variable was not reassigned
  - You did not use `var`
  - You used semicolons at the end of your statements
  - You used consistent indentation and spacing to make your code easier to read
  - You included blank lines to separate sections of code into "paragraphs"
  - You gave your files, variables, and functions useful and descriptive names
  - You used camelCase variable names
  - You did not use an array when an object makes more sense
    - An object makes more sense when you access elements by something other than position
    - Looping through or searching an array for a value is a sign you should have used an object
  - You did not use a C-Style for loop when a `for...of` loop would work
  - You used explicit `{...}` blocks for any `if (...){...}/else (...) {...}` and `for (...) {...}` constructions
  - Use semantic HTML elements when appropriate
  - Do not pick your HTML elements for their default rendered appearance
  - Do not use HTML elements to create space (no empty `<p>` elements, no `<br>` to create blank lines)
  - Properly indent HTML and CSS
  - Have no spaces around a "=" in an HTML attributes
  - Use double quotes around an HTML attribute value
  - Do not have multiple `<h1>` elements
  - Do not skip `<h1>`-`<h6>` levels
  - Each section subheading (`<h2>-<h6>`) should be a subheading of the previous heading of one number less
  - HTML/CSS classes must be semantic (not utility)
  - HTML/CSS classes must be kebab-case or BEM two dashes style
  - CSS declarations have a space after the `:`
  - CSS selectors tend to use class names

  * Do not have console.log messages related to debugging
  * Do not have commented out code
  * Do not have comments that explain what the code itself says
    - Comments should explain WHY code is doing what it does, provide context, or (very rarely) explain a dense/complex algorithm
- Any other detail mentioned in class or the instructions may be an Additional Requirement

### Bonus Requirements (Extra Credit)

These regard work done _beyond_ the requirements to get 100% on the project.  Each base requirement is worth 2 points, and the sub-requirements are describing what is necessary to fulfill the base requirement

- The visuals exceed the minimums and create a pleasant experience that removes confusion about what is happening and what the user should do
    - Do you have colors/visual spacing/whitespace to improve legibility and focus notably beyond basic requirements?
    - Do you provide a pleasant game experience in terms of understanding each turn and the state of the game?
- The game interface and information is easy and effective
    - Is it easy to see all the possible words and previous guesses?
    - Is the need to scroll over the coarse of a game minimized?
- Are you presenting additional information that demonstrates a deep understanding of state impacted by multiple users among web requests?
    - Examples include a "personal best" (low) score, a "leaderboard" showing those users with the "best" (lowest) scores
