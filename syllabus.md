Spring Semester 2025 - Mon

Instructor: Brett Ritter `<b.ritter@northeastern.edu>`
 
## Course Description

This course covers Web Development, focusing on both the fundamentals and from them modern development practices for the web.  The class will use Javascript on both the front- and backends of web application development, but the lessons learned will be applicable to many languages.  

## Topics Covered 

 - Basic git use as a version control system for shared applications and development
 - Core MVC and state concepts for both server generated HTML and client-side managed HTML
 - Core concepts of RESTful Web Service development
 - Modern JS development for the frontend (both "vanilla" JS and React-based)
 - NodeJS development of a backend end, both server generated content using the express framework (minimal) and RESTful service development
 - Basic Debugging Techniques
 - Web security fundamental practices, both front- and back-end
 - The basics of how many development teams breakdown application needs and complete work

### What is NOT covered

 - How to program in general
 - HTML and CSS details (My INFO6150 course is a great source of info here)
 - Languages other than Javascript (focus is on concepts)
 - Mobile specific development
 - Accessibility (a11y), Internationalization (i18n), or Localization (l10n)
 - SQL/NoSQL usage or database architectures/maintenance
 - Specific Libraries: Focus is on concepts and not the diverse but temporary library options
 
## Basic Requirements and Expectations:

- Basic exposure to programming concepts (variables, functions, looping) is assumed
- You will have to use git and github.com following the instructions given
- There is no textbook for the class, but a number of online articles will be shared

- Additional software (without cost) is required.  Installation and configuration is your responsibility (Mac, Windows, or \*nix)
- Students should ask questions where anything is unclear
- A great deal of work will be done online, in and out of class

## Attendance Policy

Students are expected to attend the weekly class sessions (in-person in the classroom) and ask questions whenever the lectures are unclear to them.  Barring emergencies, any absences must be requested and approved in advance.  Students registered in MGEN courses (INFO, CSYE, and DAMG) are allowed a maximum of 2 absences per course, with 3 or more absences resulting in an automatic 'F' for that course. Students are expected to inform their instructors of any absences in advance of the class; if a student is sick long-term or experiences a medical issue that prevents class attendance, it is strongly encouraged that they speak with their Academic Advisor (coe-mgen-gradadvising@northeastern.edu) to learn more about the Medical Leave of Absence. Should a student anticipate being unable to attend 3 or more classes, they should discuss their situation with their Academic Advisor to explore other types of leave in accordance with the University's academic and global entry expectations. International students should review the Office of Global Services webpage to understand their visa compliance requirements.

Teaching Assistants (TAs) or Instructional Assistants (IAs) will be present at each class to collect student attendance.

## Late Work Policy

- Students are expected to complete the weekly assignments between classes and submit to their class Github repositories by the deadline (normally before the day of the next class)
- Students are expected to complete the weekly Canvas-based quizzes between classes and submit online before the deadline (normally before the day of the next class)
- Students are expected to complete the course projects between classes and submit to their class Github repositories by the deadline (normally before the day of the next class)

Students must communicate with the faculty prior to the deadline if they anticipate work will be submitted late. Work submitted late without prior communication with faculty will not be graded. Late work submitted WITH prior communication is either granted an extension (no grade penalty) OR will be graded with a penalty and only graded after on-time assignments are graded, time-permitting.  Any submission that was not granted an extension has no guarantee that it will be graded.  

## End-of-Course Evaluation Surveys 

Your feedback regarding your educational experience in this class is particularly important to the College of Professional Studies. Your comments will make a difference in the future planning and presentation of our curriculum.

I, as the instructor, value all feedback and use it to shape further improvements in the course.

At the end of this course, please take the time to complete the evaluation survey at https://neu.evaluationkit.com. Your survey responses are completely anonymous and confidential. For courses 6 weeks in length or shorter, surveys will be open one week prior to the end of the courses; for courses greater than 6 weeks in length, surveys will be open for two weeks. An email will be sent to your Husky Mail account notifying you when surveys are available.

## Academic Integrity 

A commitment to the principles of academic integrity is essential to the mission of Northeastern University. The promotion of independent and original scholarship ensures that students derive the most from their educational experience and their pursuit of knowledge. Academic dishonesty violates the most fundamental values of an intellectual community and undermines the achievements of the entire University.

As members of the academic community, students must become familiar with their rights and responsibilities. In each course, they are responsible for knowing the requirements and restrictions regarding research and writing, examinations of whatever kind, collaborative work, the use of study aids, the appropriateness of assistance, and other issues. Students are responsible for learning the conventions of documentation and acknowledgment of sources in their fields. Northeastern University expects students to complete all examinations, tests, papers, creative projects, and assignments of any kind according to the highest ethical standards, as set forth either explicitly or implicitly in this Code or by the direction of instructors.
